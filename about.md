I'm a PhD student in computational medicine and [bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics) at UMich and a National Science Foundation [Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I like to think about ways we can use deep learning and computer vision to both improve the diagnosis of disease and to draw interesting insights about the functional organization of the brain.
