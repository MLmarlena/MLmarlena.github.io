![an image alt text]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/uber_pic.png )

I'm a PhD student in computational medicine and [bioinformatics](https://medicine.umich.edu/dept/computational-medicine-bioinformatics) at UMich and a National Science Foundation [Graduate Research Fellow](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/). I like to think about ways we can use deep learning and computer vision to both improve the diagnosis of disease and to draw interesting insights about the functional organization of the brain. 

I am passionate about #SciComm, as well as promoting diversity and inclusion in science and technology. As such, I am an Executive Committee member of [Girls Who Code @ UMich DCMB](http://umich.edu/~girlswc/), a club designed to teach computational data science and analytical programming in Python to high school girls. I'll be serving as the GWC Summer Camp chair, designing a curriculum for data science bootcamp beginning Summer 2019.
