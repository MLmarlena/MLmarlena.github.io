title: GTC 2018 Recap

What do video games and deep learning have in common? What about self-driving cars and animation? At first glance, you may think these are compltely unrelated fields, but at their core they share something very important - they are all powered by GPUs.  

I spent the better part of last week in sunny San Jose, CA at the Nvidia GPU Technology Conference - a gathering of experts in artificial intelligence, computer graphics, robotics and more. This was a welcome respite for me, not only because I was able to escape the bitterly cold Michigan "spring" we've been having, but also because it allowed me to step back from the weeds of my own work and once again be inspired by the creativity of others. Coming off of an especially harsh stats test and having my prelim topic approved and oral defense scheduled, believe me when I say it could not have come at a better time. I was anxious to attend this conference alone and dive headfirst in to a world that I had only thusfar toed the waters of, but anxious in the sense of being excited as well as being cripplingly nervous. What if I said something that gave away that I'm a total n00b at deep learning and GPUs? But what if I said something really impressive and made awesome connections that could help with my career goals?? Only time would tell ...

###Day One - learn to deep learn
