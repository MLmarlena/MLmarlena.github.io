Welcome to my blog! Here I'll be sharing my deep learning experiments, details of building my first custom rig, and my personal insights into exciting applications of machine learning. It is my hope that this blog can serve as a resource for those interested in getting started with deep learning and to help make cutting-edge developments in the field more accessible to a wider audience. 

Hope you enjoy - happy reading!
